        <h1>Coffee Shop Simulator</h1>
        <h2>Global Game Jam</h2>
        <p class="date">Jan 26, 2024 - Jan 28, 2024</p>
        <p>Artist, programmer, page organizer.<br>
            A silly, endless game created in a group of four called Vegan Milk with Chocolate. This was our<br>
            first Game Jam experience so we weren't sure what to expect from it. It was also our first time <br>
            using Godot, learning it as we made the game. I prioritized asset creation, scene creation <br>
            and switches, and some interactability between ingredients.<br><br>
        
            You play as a barista serving customers in the middle of nowhere. It's your duty to fulfill everyone's<br>
            orders correctly, or else test.png will be disappointed. The game is endless as long as you don't make<br>
            more than three mistakes!</p>

        <h1>The Eternal Crown</h1>
        <h2>Class Project</h2>
        <p class="date">Jan 2023 - April 2023</p>
        <p>Artist, programmer and debugger.<br>
            A simple RPG created with a small group of people in my Game Dev & Algorithmic Problem Solving class.<br>
            The game was hardcoded in C# using MonoGame. I focused primarily on debugging, fixing & cleaning code,<br>
            as well as creating all the assets and figuring out how to implement them into the game.<br><br>
            
            You play as an adventurer whose goal is to travel through a forest in order to find "The Eternal Crown."<br>
            This crown is promised to give eternal life, and it's your goal to obtain it by whatever means necessary.</p>

        <h2>Solo Class Project</h2>
        <p>This was my first Unity project, being tasked with creating a SHMUP without using Unity's<br>
            collision system. It was a fun task trying to figure out how to work with Unity's interface, as well as<br>
            creating a functional game.<br><br>
            
            You're a dinosaur simply living life as a cowboy. You're as happy as you can be... until you recieve a letter.<br>
            It's from the IRS!? This is outrageous, cowboys should not have to pay taxes.</p>

        <p>The second project I've created in Unity, being a simulation of critters roaming an environment.<br>
            Each insect has a variety of states such as: Hunting, eating, fleeing, grouping and roaming.<br>
            All of which are affected by the creatures surrounding it. They also avoid obstacles as well as walls.<br><br>

            You watch a lively environment full of insects, being able to place as many blue critters as you desire.<br>
            They hunt the never-dying flock of bat-bugs, and are eaten by the ferocious red one.</p>

                <p>A scrapped brown bug. The original idea was to have a playable bug character, but lacked time to implement.</p>

        <h1>Pokemon Team Generator</h1>
        <h2>Solo Class Project</h2>
        <p class="date">Nov 15, 2023 - Nov 29, 2023</p>
        <p>I was tasked to use one of a select few of available APIs to create a website based on it.<br>
            I chose Pokemon as it is a loved series of mine. The website is a team builder which allows<br>
            the user to create either completely random or pre-determined teams based off its search functions.<br><br>
        
            The only thing I would change about this website now that it's "completed" is to add the ability to<br>
            save formed teams. Currently only the user's settings are locally stored, however implementing a<br>
            team saving option should not be too hard to implement.</p>
