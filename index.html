                    I'm a <b class="blue">game designer</b>, <b class="pink">artist</b>, and <b class="purple">MSPaint enthusiast</b>!<br><br>

                    I'm currently a third year Game Design & Development student at the <b class="yellow">Rochester Institute of Technology.</b>
                    Here you can look through my <a class="yellow" href="resume.html">resume</a>, a variety of different <a class="yellow" href="projects/professional.html">projects</a> ranging from professional to fun side ones, as well as my <a class="
                    yellow" href="portfolio.html">artistic portfolio</a>!<br><br>

                    My current skillset includes a variety of different programming languages,  game engines, as well as a handful of artistic programs. I am a completely self-taught digital and traditional artist, with classes only strengthening the pre-existing skills I had already aquired throughout my life. Programming, on the other hand, was something I learned throughout college. I had less then zero knowledge prior to becoming a student, however I am a passionate learner and have picked up most knowledge with ease.<br><br>
                    The languages I am familiar with are <b class="blue">C#, C++, Javascript, and HTML</b>. I am currently still developing my C++ skills, however.
                    The programming softwares & game engines I am familiar with are <b class="purple">Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Unity, and Godot</b>. I am still getting myself comfortable with using Unity and Godot, however.
                    The artist programs I am familar with are <b class="pink">Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Aseprite, Toon Boom, Adobe Substance Painter, Maya, and Blender</b>. As well as MSPaint, my beloved. I am comfortable using each of these programs!<br><br>

                    Personally, I would consider myself a jack of all trades; a <b class="purple">unicorn</b> if you will. I feel comfortable and confident no matter the tasks I am given, however I tend to lean on the design-aspects of projects if given a choice.
