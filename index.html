        <h1>Hello, I am Goose!</h1>
        <p>I am currently a second-year college student studying Game Design & Development.<br>
            I've been interested in video games my entire life, coming up with ideas ever since I was a child.<br>
            I am interested in both the technical and design aspects of games, wanting to develop my skills in both.<br><br>

            I enjoy drawing, reading comics, and designing in my free time!<br><br>

            This website contains my portfolio, projects, and commission information!</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
            Coding-wise I know & understand C#, Javascript and HTML, and am familiar with Visual Studio,<br>
            Visual Studio Code, Unity, and Godot. I am new to everything programming, however I have picked<br>
            these up with ease. I am always open to learning up new languages and experimenting with what I am given.<br>
            <u>I am currently learning: C++</u><br><br>

            Art-wise I am comfortable with creating both realistic and cartoony art pieces, and am more than willing to<br>
            experiment with my style. I'm familiar with programs such as Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, and Toon Boom.<br>
            I hope to progress my animation, character design & world building capabilities throughout the next few years.<br>
            <u>I am currently learning: Maya, Blender</u>
