                            Play as an Entomoid, a completely customizable insect-like creature, as you engage in typical fantasy adventures through the tiny lens of a pre-medieval society of star-worshipping entomoids just like you!<br><br>

                        <h3 class="purple">What Is It?</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Lights of Entoma, players step into the antennae of Entomoids—a world of intelligent, mutated, and sentient bugs whose lives are guided by both instinct and intrigue. These creatures are not mere insects; they are evolved and complex beings with societies, faiths, and mysteries as layered as their exoskeleton.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="purple">What Makes it Unique...</h3>
                        <p>
                            One key feature that sets LoE apart is its use of cards instead of traditional rolling dice. This choice introduces a fresh dynamic to gameplay, leaning into narrative depth and decision-making while also incorporating moments of random chance. Each player having their own hand during play offers a set of known possibilities to draw from, allowing for more strategy and planning within each character’s journey. The result is a system that fosters a more immersive, roleplay-focused experience where storytelling and character choices can shine.<br>
                        </p>
    
                        <h3 class="purple">Character Creation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Character creation in LoE is a fully customizable experience that allows players to design an Entomoid exactly how they envision, without the limitations of predefined classes or races like in many TTRPGs. Instead of being boxed into traditional roles, players mix and match different body parts and traits to create a character with abilities, strengths, and weaknesses tailored to their playstyle.<br>
    
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is a project I am actively working with alongside 5 others. Each of us work on equal parts of LoE, from creating artwork to inventing mechanics.<br>
                            My tasks included:<br>
                            <b class="yellow">
                                - Coming up with the original idea, as well as the initial cores of the systems.<br>
                                - Coming up with character-creation system, which negates the issues found in specialization, while not outright removing it.<br>
                                - Drawing a majority of the artwork found, including the cover and back images.<br><br>
                            </b>

                            Lights of Entoma was an incredible learning opportunity for myself, as I got to learn about Tabletop RPG creation and the importance of getting it right. Despite the fact we were able to publish in just a few months, there is so much more we, Big Bugs Ink., want to work on.<br>

                        <p>
                            This was a group project where I, alongside 4 others, were tasked with creating a game from scratch. We were given no guidance, resources, or instructions on how to create our game. It was completely up to us.<br>
                            My tasks included:<br>
                            <b class="yellow">
                                - Building a dialogue system using GDScript and JSON files.<br>
                                - Creating 2D dialogue boxes that changed size depending on the amount of dialogue.<br>
                                - Inputting sounds in a variety of places, from ambience to responsive.<br>
                                - Recorded and edited the trailer using OBS Studio and DaVinci Resolve.<br><br>
                            </b>

                            Servo's Delivery was the first <i>real</i> game I worked on in the engine Godot. Before this project, I touched it lightly in game jams and tests, but not enough to be familiar with it. Learning GDScript as well as the engine as a whole was an incredibly fun learning experience!<br>

                            You open your eyes to an unusual foggy void, with seemingly no one in sight. You give yourself a moment to look at your surroundings; there's a comically large target straight ahead, along with a bright red canon beside you. Your first customer approaches, they seem... kind enough... requesting a Vegan Milk with Chocolate? What are they talking about? You turn around to see a table full of ingredients. It's your job to make these customers unusual drinks, but try not to mess up as test.png won't be happy...<br><br>

                            Vegan Milk with Chocolate brings you a Global Game Jam game! This was my absolute first Game Jam experience, joining it with three other friends of mine who were also new to it.<br>
                            My tasks included:<br>
                            <b class="yellow">
                                - Creating every single asset and implementing them into the game.<br>
                                - Creating each of the scenes in-game, allowing for the player to understand what their goal is.<br>
                                - Amplifying the uneasy setting via lights and intense fog.<br><br>
                            </b>
                            This was my first time learning and using Godot, which was an incredible experience! It was a 72-hour event where I, along with my teammates, worked nonstop to create it!<br>

                            Spare Parts is a cyberpunk character creator game that focuses on exploring the 6 economic districts of a futuristic city to find new replacement body parts and modifications. You will play as a character from one of the 6 districts with each district granting the player a different boon.<br><br>

                            While balancing their three core stats (strength, health, and humanity) players will build up their arsenal by choosing a district to explore each turn. When you explore a district you will pull from a deck which will be filled with parts, events, and power-ups that are themed around the district you’re exploring.<br>

                            <p>
                                This was a class project where I, along with 4 others, were tasked with creating a board game from scratch. We were instructed to create a final product that could be passed as a professional game pitch.<br>
                                My tasks included:<br>
                                <b class="yellow">
                                    - Designed each of the cards, as well as participated in naming and describing them.<br>
                                    - Painted the design of the box, adding crucial information for Players to read.<br>
                                    - Worked on a variety of gameplay mechanics, such as specialized perks and unique events.<br><br>
                                </b>

                                Spare Parts was the first board game I had ever worked on, being an incredible learning experience! It taught me how to be creative with my game design, as I had to physically create pieces and use what was realistically available to me. It was a challenge making sure all the pieces and mechanics were balanced, but it ended up great in the end.<br>

                        <p>
                            You open on a view of the player character moving through a forest, a gleam in their eye as they move forward with intent. They enter into a clearing, and ahead of them standards a thicker, darker stretch of forest. You flash a greedy smile as you stride confidently forward. But as you do, a Skeleton appears...<br><br>

                            ...Clad in the remains of their armor, and equipped with a rusting sword, the skeleton mindlessly lunges towards you, sword outstretched. As you fight against this undead adversary, you notice a faint gleam of green in their eye. After defeating them, you stride into the darker stretch, and find yourself in a maze of trees and vines. You hear the clacking of bones, more undead fighters, as well as a faint squishing sound which you can’t place. Your path to the crown will not be easy, winding through the wood and blocked by many who would hinder your progress. But you will have your prize. Nothing, NOTHING, will stop you from getting… the Eternal Crown.<br>

                            This was the absolute first game I have ever made, being with a group of people within one of my college classes. We had full creative liberties when it came to what we made, but needed to make sure we kept our scope small and focus on lesser, detailed qualities rather than multiple, less-developed ones. This game was a true learning experience, it allowed me to grow familiar with working with a team of people with different strengths and weaknesses, as well as figure out our own schedule and scope.<br>

                                - Multiple ways to defeat enemies (shooting or ramming into for less points)<br><br>

                            This was a class project, the first solo one I received. I was tasked to create a SHMUP from scratch; no using any of Unity's preset collision detections! Other than that, it was completely up to me what theme I wanted... and what better than to mash up three completely different ideas? Dinosaurs, cowboys, and the IRS... who would have thought! Since this was also my first time using Unity, it was fun learning the interface and trying to figure out how to get certain things such as bullet spawning and random enemy positions to work.<br>

                            Some notable aspects of this game:<br>
                            <b class="yellow">
                                - A saved highscore based off of local storage<br>
                                - Sound effects for the full game<br>
                                - A higher enemy spawn rate as time goes on<br>
                                - A way for the player to keep moving forever using fairy bread and presice movement<br>
                                - Different enemy types, with different speeds<br><br>

                            My first web-game class project, tasked to create a playable experience with a functional gameloop! I decided on an infinite runner type game that gets progressively harder over time! PIXI.js was interesting to say the least, needing to utilize everything I learned throughout my time at RIT to create something fun on a web browser. There were some challenges I faced such as struggling with debugging and learning how the engine worked in general, but all went well!<br>
