                        <p>
                            This was an internship over the summer of 2024, where I and a small team of people worked together to create the barebones of a website!<br>
                            My tasks included:<br>
                            <b class="yellow">
                                - Asset production for the Hero and text boxes<br>
                                - Focusing on the CSS of the Home page and Draw page<br>
                                - Coming up with a variety of different gameplay ideas<br><br>
                            </b>

                            Crowd Comic was the first internship I ever had, and the first time I used my web-design skills in a professional setting. It allowed me to learn TypeScript and Bootstrap, as well as learn how to properly host websites.<br>
